0: Force z prepass off. 1: Force on. -1: Don't force
0: Use normals reconstructed from depth. 1: Output correct normals in z prepass.
0: run all send jobs on main thread; 1: send jobs run asynchronously (except on dedicated server); 2: send jobs asynchronously; 3: send jobs run in parallel but block to not overlap the next tick; 4: main server clients' send jobs run in parallel, then HLTV server jobs; this approximately matches pre-async profile for a single HLTV server configuration

By default, player must ack delta ticks in order. How to enforce it: 2 = kick all clients, 1 = kick only TV clients, 0 = do not kick.
By default, player must maintain a reliable connection to Steam servers. When player Steam session drops, enforce it: 2 = instantly kick, 1 = kick at next spawn, 0 = do not kick.

If non-zero, client binds port to specific address.  Usually you should leave this blank to use a different random system-assigned port for each connection.
If set to 1, the server calculates data and fills packets to bots. Used for perf testing.
If set, only members of Steam group will be able to join the server when it's empty, public people will be able to join the server only if it has players.
If set, whenever a game ends, if the total memory used by the server is greater than this # of megabytes, the server will exit.
If the binding doesn't work and you're not using a US English keyboard, you should try:
If true when log when a query is blocked (can cause very large log files)
If true, resets the input device when there was a long enough hitch between callbacks.
Ignore VAC and auth errors for client connected via localhost address or in-engine loopback

When connecting to local listen server (for example, using the 'map' command), default to loopback=false, which connects to '127.0.0.1' instead of 'loopback'.  This uses the network stack so that fake lag/loss can be simulated.
When enabled, changes in tv_enable convars cause immediate startup or shutdown of hltv server
When enabled, game server will quit immediately via syscall instead of running host states shutdown sequence
When enabled, open the voip audio input stream when the application launches.
When enabled, this allows for entity packing to use the property changes for building up the data. This is many times faster, but can be disabled for error checking.
When enabled, this will collect all information for relay sending into a single datagram to ensure that the data stays together through a potentially large number of relays
When enabled, this will use a uniquely generated server code to authenticate relay connections. This code is coordinated via the GC or some external means rather than by clients directly
When enabled, this will use a uniquely generated server code to authenticate relay to relay connections. This code is coordinated via the GC or some external means rather than by clients directly
When encoding entity deltas, append on a random number of extra bytes.  This happens after sv_dev_entitydeltapadding_min_size.
When encoding entity deltas, if the delta size is < N bytes, then shove in N dummy bytes.  This happens before sv_dev_entitydeltapadding_extra_min/sv_dev_entitydeltapadding_extra_max
When encoding entity deltas, instead of unreliably deducing explicit deletions, actually send list of existing but not networked entities (dont_transmit list) to each client.
When packing entities, check that recipient bits match for fast path packing.
When r_low_latency is enabled, this moves the low latency sleep on tick frames to happen after client simulation.
When receiving packets out of sequence, wait this many seconds for missing sequences to arrive
When the client is catching up in low frame rate situations, should we run client simulate more than once a frame?
When the client is catching up in low frame rate situations, should we run tick more than once a frame?
When true, elapsed time given to the input processing will be the time elapsed since the last input processing. This is only relevant when input is processed multiple times per frame ( i.e. multiple ticks per frame)
When upstream packet jitter in a frame exceeds this threshold (ms), the frame is considered to have 'irregular delivery'.  This is a derived value and should not be modified manually
Whether dedicated server is pausable when running -dev and playing solo against bots
Whether diagnostic logging is enabled when clients ack delta ticks out of order. Policy: 2 = log all out of order acks, 1 = log only when disconnect is triggered, 0 = do not log.
Whether listen server is pausable when running -dev and playing solo against bots
Whether server supports banid command
Whether we should ignore the user config file for reading/writing.
